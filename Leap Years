// In this kata you should simply determine, whether a given year is a leap year or not. In case you don't know the rules, here they are:
// Years divisible by 4 are leap years,
// but years divisible by 100 are not leap years,
// but years divisible by 400 are leap years.
// Tested years are in range 1600 ≤ year ≤ 4000.

                                        return false}
    let isDivisible4 = year % 4 == 0
