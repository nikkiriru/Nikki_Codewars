// You take your son to the forest to see the monkeys. You know that there are a certain number there (n), but your son is too young to just appreciate the full number, he has to start counting them from 1.
// As a good parent, you will sit and count with him. Given the number (n), populate an array with all numbers up to and including that number, but excluding zero.
// For example(Input --> Output):
// 10 --> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
// 1 --> [1]
