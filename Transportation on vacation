// After a hard quarter in the office you decide to get some rest on a vacation. So you will book a flight for you and your girlfriend and try to leave all the mess behind you.
// You will need a rental car in order for you to get around in your vacation. The manager of the car rental makes you some good offers.
// Every day you rent the car costs $40. If you rent the car for 7 or more days, you get $50 off your total. Alternatively, if you rent the car for 3 or more days, you get $20 off your total.
// Write a code that gives out the total amount for different days(d).

func RentalCarCost(_ days: Int) -> Int {
    var totalCost = 0
    var calculatedAmount = 0

    let oneDayCost = 40
    let moreThanThreeDays = 20
    let moreThanSevenDays = 50

    guard days > 0 else { return totalCost }
    calculatedAmount = days * oneDayCost
    let threeDaysOffer =  calculatedAmount - moreThanThreeDays
    let sevenDaysOffer =  calculatedAmount - moreThanSevenDays

    totalCost = days >= 7 ? sevenDaysOffer : days >= 3 ? threeDaysOffer : calculatedAmount
