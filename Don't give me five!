// In this kata you get the start number and the end number of a region and should return the count of all numbers except numbers with a 5 in it. The start and the end number are both inclusive!
// Examples:
// 1,9 -> 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9 -> Result 8
// 4,17 -> 4,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,16,17 -> Result 12
// The result may contain fives.
// The start number will always be smaller than the end number. Both numbers can be also negative!
