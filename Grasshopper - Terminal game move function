// Terminal game move function
// In this game, the hero moves from left to right. The player rolls the dice and moves the number of spaces indicated by the dice two times.
// Create a function for the terminal game that takes the current position of the hero and the roll (1-6) and return the new position.
// Example:
// move(3, 6) should equal 15

func move(_ p: Int, _ r: Int) -> Int {
    let dice = 1...6
    guard dice.contains(r) else {print("There is no such number on our dice")
                                return p}
    return p + r * 2
}
